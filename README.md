# AutoRAY - A new Era of VPNs
### What is AutoRAY?
- AutoRAY is a python program that connects to the Telegram API and helps you scrape V2ray configurations and pack them into a subscription (Flask Route/HTTP Response)
### What is it exactly?
- Clients like [V2rayNG](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayNG) and [Hiddify](https://github.com/hiddify/hiddify-next) let you add subscriptions, This way you can provide the v2ray configs to your client without the need to leave the app.
- AutoRAY saves a ton of time by doing the "finding the configs" process automatically.

### How can i use it?
- You have two options, use the community servers OR self-host your own Autoray server
